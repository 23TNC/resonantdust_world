 * for singletons (e.g. `"details"`, `"chat"`).
 *
 * Callers use `ensure(id, factory)` to get-or-create — if the id is
 * already in the registry, the existing panel is focused and
 * returned; otherwise the factory runs and the new panel is
 * registered. Panels self-unregister when they `destroy()` (the
 * manager subscribes to their `onDestroy` event during `ensure`).
 *
 * `focused(prefix)` returns the most-recently-focused panel whose
 * id begins with `${prefix}:` (or equals `prefix` for singletons).
 * Used by global key handlers to route input — e.g. KeyE goes to
 * `panels.focused("inventory")`, Space to `panels.focused("gameview")`.
 *
 * Cascade-offset state lives here so new free-floating panels open
 * staggered rather than stacking exactly on top of each other.
 * Anchored panels (those that set `right` / `left` / pin to an edge)
 * ignore the offset — they're already pinned to a corner and
 * stacking is unavoidable.
