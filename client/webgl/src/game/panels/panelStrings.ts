/** Panel UI string lookups. Resolves panel chrome strings — titles,
 *  buttons, row labels, placeholders — scoped to the `panels` locale
 *  domain (`content/locales/panels/<lang>.json`).
 *
 *  Schema: each panel is one locale entry keyed by its
 *  `view/src/content/panels/defaults.json` panel key. Its `label` is the
 *  title-bar text; every other string is a flat variant. So
 *  `panelTitle("settingsMenu")` → "Settings" and
 *  `panelText("settingsMenu", "logOut")` → "Log Out".
 *
 *  **Two sources, in order:** the gate-served `sharedLocales()` catalog
 *  first (so a live language switch / content reload wins), then a
 *  build-time **bundled** English copy of the panels domain. The bundle
 *  matters because panels are app-global chrome built at boot — settings,
 *  debug HUD, the per-panel settings popup all exist on the login screen,
 *  *before* any gate content has loaded. Without the bundle their labels
 *  would freeze at the raw key fallback. The bare key is the final
 *  fallback so a missing translation renders the dev-side key rather than
 *  throwing. */
