# Primitive graph — forks

_Decision points. **F1–F4 RESOLVED by the user 2026-07-25.** F5–F7 remain._

## F1 — Is the graph resolved on the CPU, or walked on the GPU? ✅ RESOLVED — BOTH POSSIBLE (2026-07-25)
**Resolved by adding `u16 parent_id`** to `light_data`/`billboard_data` and a `child` bit to `prim_data`
(reinterpreting RED's top half as `parent_id`). The graph is navigable **upward**, so the choice is no
longer architectural — it's per-consumer:
- **CPU resolves** for `light_presence` / `billboard_presence` / bucketing (user: "the CPU can work out
  what needs to be written"). It has to: deciding which tiles a light reaches *requires* its world position.
- **GPU can resolve** where needed (user: "with parent ids allocated, the GPU should also be able to if
  required") — bounded walk, constant loop + `break`.

**Remaining sub-decision** ([I11](issues.md#i11)): the gather's per-texel-per-light loop should NOT walk
chains. Either the CPU stamps a resolved absolute position into the leaf (lean — it already computes it)
or the walk is accepted with a `MAX_DEPTH` cap. Bit-home for the stamped position → [B2](blockers.md#b2).

## F2 — What do the tile buckets hold? ✅ RESOLVED — LEAVES (2026-07-25)
`light_presence` holds **`light_data` ids**; **`billboard_presence`** (renamed from the caster buckets)
holds **`billboard_data` ids**. Decisive reasoning (user): bucketing *carriers* makes the per-tile
billboard count **unbounded**, since a carrier fans out to ≤4 recursively. Leaf bucketing keeps the
corridor walk at today's cost, 8 slots/tile.

## F3 — Child offset encoding ✅ RESOLVED — BIAS-8 (2026-07-25)
Signed via bias-8 per nibble (−8..+7 tiles / units), so children can be placed in any direction.

## F4 — Header count width ✅ DISSOLVED (2026-07-25)
Superseded by **fixed 8-px commands** — there is no count field. See F7.

## F5 — Does `prim_data` need a type/identity field? (2026-07-25, OPEN, low-stakes)
`prim_data` is pure structure (position/flags/4 refs); nothing says "this is a pawn". Fine for rendering
(presentation lives in the leaves) but gameplay/picking/debug may eventually want an object id. `G` has
`u3 reserved` after the `child` bit. **Lean: leave it out** until a consumer needs it.

## F6 — Dirty entry points, inherited (2026-07-25, carried over from light-prims)
`markPrimDirty` / `markBillboardDirty` / `markLightDirty` → `pendingRects` → `buildDirty`, cold/hot
routing generalised. **New wrinkle from inheritance:** a carrier's `hot_cold` flip (or a re-facing that
swaps definitions) re-classes its whole subtree, so the cascade must walk **down** the children — which
the CPU resolve pass already does. `parent_id` additionally lets a leaf's dirty find its carrier.

## F7 — Partial-command indexing (2026-07-25, OPEN, mechanical)
A command writes ≤7 records to one set; the trivial map (record `p` → command `p/7`, slot `p%7`) assumes
full commands. **(a)** pad by repeating an id+payload (safe — the scatter is absolute + replay-idempotent);
**(b)** upload the `(command, slot)` pair per point via the existing `aIndex` attribute.
**Lean: (b)** — no wasted writes, and `scatterGeo` already carries a per-point integer attribute.
